            Urban Dictionary Says:<br><br>
            1) A PC based operating system by Microsoft. <br><br>

            2) An opening in a house, building, or other structure to provide view and ventilation. <br><br>

            3) A slang term for crystal meth (methamphetamine). Derived from the term "glass" which is also a word used to describe crystal meth. Windows as in def. 2 are often made of glass. In some tweaker's meth addled mind "glass" equaled "windows" and a new meaning for the word was born. In addition the term seems appropriate as many tweakers either work in the computer field or enjoy computing in their spare time (as relating to def. 1). <br><br>
